### The Challenge
In India, there are **over 950+ government welfare schemes** designed to uplift citizens across various sectors - from education and healthcare to agriculture and entrepreneurship. However, accessing information about these schemes presents significant barriers:

**🚧 Language Barriers**
- Most official documentation is in English or Hindi only
- Regional language speakers struggle to understand eligibility criteria
- Complex bureaucratic language makes schemes inaccessible to common citizens

**📋 Information Complexity**
- Scattered information across multiple government portals
- Lengthy documents with unclear application processes
- Citizens unaware of schemes they're eligible for

**🔍 Discovery Problem**
- No centralized, user-friendly platform for scheme discovery
- Manual research required across hundreds of government websites
- Time-consuming process deters potential beneficiaries

**♿ Accessibility Issues**
- Non-intuitive government websites
- Lack of voice-based assistance for less tech-savvy users
- No personalized recommendations based on individual circumstances

### Impact on Citizens
